<p align="center"> <mark>Info below is for Pony Town only</mark> </p>

<p align="center"> I go AFK a lot. I talk mostly to people in my party. I sometimes interact with friends/others if I have the time. I don't really like to chat but you're free to leave whispers. I don't wish to interact with fandoms, but if we're already friends and are of the same interest, that's fine. </p>

<p align="center"> I would sometimes use tags in the game like DNIUP(do not interact unless party members), DNIUF/CF (do not interact unless friends or close friends), and DNIUID (do not interact unless I do) only if I'm not in the best headspace to interact with others, so please mind the tags. </p>

<p align="center"> Use the name Luther when referring to me in the game and please avoid asking personal questions. I will not be responding to them. Avoid assuming things about me. Don't be weird. </p>

<p align="center"> Don't copy my skins. Always ask before taking inspo. </p>
