<p style="text-align:center"><strong>I go AFK a lot.</strong> I talk mostly to people in my party. I sometimes interact with friends/others if I have the time. I don't really like to chat but <strong>you're free to leave whispers. </strong>I don't wish to interact with fandoms. If we're already friends and are of the same interest, that's fine.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Use the name Luther when referring to me in the game. </strong>I'm not comfortable using my own name in public, and please avoid asking personal questions. I will not be responding to them. <strong>Don't copy my skins. Always ask before taking inspo.</strong></p>
